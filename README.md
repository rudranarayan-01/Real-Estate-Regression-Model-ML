This is a Machine Learning Regression Project. In this I use real estate data of the city Banglore in different locations with multiple factors . This model aims to predict the expected price of the house by taking input sqft, bedrooms and bathrooms and which location we wants to buy.
In this I use NGNIX and Flask for web request manipuration and for the model first I clean and then transform the data using One Hot Encoding and then apply K fold algorithm for getting best suitable algo in which it gives better accuracy.

To run this model Run Ngnix and server.py which is inside server directory


cd server
python server.py

run NGNIX
